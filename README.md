🚀 This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of the projects I developed during my Python internship at CodSoft, showcasing my proficiency in building functional command-line applications. The collection features four distinct tasks: first, a robust To-Do List Application 📝 that implements persistent storage using JSON to allow users to add, view, update, and delete tasks seamlessly across sessions; second, a versatile Simple Calculator 🧮 capable of handling standard arithmetic plus power operations, complete with error handling for zero division and smart integer formatting; third, a secure Password Generator 🔒 that creates randomized strings of user-specified lengths by combining letters, digits, and punctuation for enhanced security; and finally, an engaging Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮 where users play against the computer with a continuous game loop that tracks live scores and declares a final winner. Collectively, these scripts demonstrate practical implementation of Python's core libraries—including json, os, random, and string—to solve real-world programming challenges 🐍
